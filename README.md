# A Complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Covid-19 Pandemic and Vaccination Progress from 2020 to 2023
## About the project
I used [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)'s COVID-19 to find some knowledge about this pandemic. The analysis shows which country has the most death/confirmed rate and which of them are safe and fast in the vaccination progress. These metrics also have been evaluated state by state in the US. More details about the features and download link of the dataset at https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data. See the results in the notebooks.
## Tools
